# singedAddition
signedAddition

### Description

A program (in C++) that first asks the user to input a signed number, for example 48, then converts it to binary number by using Twoâ€™s Complement. Do the same for the second inputted number, e.g., -17. Then compute the summation of these two numbers, output the results in binary format first, then if there is an overflow, display error message; otherwise, convert the result to decimal value and show it on the screen, e.g., 48 + (-17) = 29.

Your program should repeat the above process until the user chooses to exit your program. Note that there is no limit to the number of bits your program can handle. For convenience, your program can assume it is for eight bit binary numbers. Also assume all inputs are valid. You CANNOT use library functions in the header file like bitset to implement it.
